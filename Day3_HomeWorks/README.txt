    Authorized Back End
    Add token based auth to your previous backend. 
    Create in your database a "user" collection with username and password, using the right tool to hash passwords.
    Create a service test with two endpoints:
    - Register (username, password): creates a new valid user
    - Login: returns a token for access API
    - Enable Authorization on the other endpoints making them available only to registered users
    [EXTRA]
    Implement refresh token technique
    Additional notes: if you prefer you can choose to use npm packages dedicated to authentication purposes like
	Passport
